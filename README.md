# job_finder

Job Finder is an interactive web application allowing users to search for available jobs nearby, favorite/unfavorite jobs and receive personalized recommendations based on user favorite history and location info. 

<p>As an aspiring software engineer, it is not easy to take the first step in the job market, especially under the current circumstances. I would like to practice my skills in recommendation algorithsms and the fundamentals in Java, MySQL based back-end and HTML/CSS/JavaScript based front-end.
We have many amazing and convenient frameworks to use today but it is very important to be able to write "raw" code and understand the logic in the pure lanaguages.</p>

Here are what I did for this project:
<ul>
<li>Built from scratch the front-end web development by implementing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, wire framing user flow, designing database, and test functionality to troubleshoot</li>
<li>Sustained fast and safe database management and communication by implementing RESTful APIs using Java servlets, retrieving job descriptions using GitHub API and storing data in MySQL</li>
<li>Realized personalized job recommendations by extracting keywords from job descriptions (Monkey Learn API), acquiring user geo location and implementing a content-based algorithm</li>
</ul>

<strong>Key features</strong>:
<ul>
  <li>Fully functional user registration, login, logout with encrpted password and front-end validations</li>
  <li>Ability to search jobs nearby using browser geo-location or IP address location info with GitHub Job API</li>
  <li>Cool feature of favorating/liking and unfavorating/unliking jobs</li>
  <li>Personalized job recommendations based on location info and job description keyword extraction supported by Monkey Learn API and self-written content based algorithm</li>
</ul>
